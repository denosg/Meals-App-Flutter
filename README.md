# meals_app
Introducing "Meals" - the ultimate Flutter mobile cross-platform app for food lovers! With a sleek and intuitive design, the app offers a wide range of delicious and diverse meal options to cater to every taste bud. From Italian cuisine to quick and easy recipes, burgers, German dishes, light and lovely options, and more, Meals has got you covered.
But that's not all - Meals also features a handy settings tab that allows users to customize their meal preferences, whether they want lactose-free, vegetarian, or gluten-free meals. The settings tab can be easily accessed through the app's drawer, which also displays the Meals categories.
When users select a particular meal category, they are presented with a list of mouth-watering meal options to choose from. Once they select a meal, they can view detailed instructions on how to make it, including the difficulty level and a list of ingredients needed. The app also offers a favorites tab where users can save their preferred meals for future reference.
What I learned during development:
-	How to create a beautiful interface using the Material Design Widgets
-	How to create a drawer which stores the different categories in the app
-	How to pass data from and to a different tab in the app
-	How to create a bottom tab list that shows different tabs the user can press
-	How to divide the app in smaller portions for easier reading and understanding of the app
